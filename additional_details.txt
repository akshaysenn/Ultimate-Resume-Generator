**About Me**  
I am a highly motivated individual with a strong background in technology, leadership, and entrepreneurship. My journey has been defined by a commitment to innovation and making a positive impact.

I was the Runner-up at the Youth Entrepreneurship Championship at IIT Kanpur, which reinforced my passion for technology-driven solutions. As a volunteer at Cognizance, IIT Roorkee, I actively contribute to various events and workshops, fostering a culture of learning and collaboration.

I co-founded LearnTechX, a company dedicated to developing cutting-edge technology for women's safety. Our flagship safety device is designed to deliver a shock to potential attackers while simultaneously sending live location-based emergency alerts to designated family members.

As a Brand Executive at TEACHNOOK, I led a team of over 170 individuals, ensuring their motivation, support, and success. Additionally, I worked as a freelance User Acceptance Tester at Embibe, focusing on QA testing and improving software quality.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science from Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya and am actively involved in GDSC and Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (LSA) programs at my college. My passion for continuous learning is reflected in my certifications in Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Web Development.
